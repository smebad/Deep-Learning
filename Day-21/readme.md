# Deep Learning Journey - Day 21: Pooling Layer in CNN

## Introduction to Pooling Layer in CNN

In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the **Pooling Layer** is a crucial component that helps in reducing the spatial dimensions of feature maps while retaining important information. Pooling layers achieve this by applying a down-sampling operation, which simplifies the computation and helps in making the model more robust to variations in the input.

### **Types of Pooling:**
1. **Max Pooling** - Selects the maximum value from a given region.
2. **Average Pooling** - Computes the average value from a given region.

Pooling layers play a vital role in:
- Reducing computation by lowering the number of parameters.
- Preventing overfitting by eliminating unnecessary details.
- Enhancing feature extraction by focusing on dominant values.
- Improving the model's ability to generalize across different images.

## **What I Did in This Notebook**

In this notebook, I experimented with the **Max Pooling** layer in a CNN using the **MNIST dataset**. The main steps involved are:

1. **Loading and Preprocessing the MNIST Dataset:**
   - Normalized pixel values to a range of [0,1].
   - Reshaped images for CNN input format.

2. **Building the CNN Model with Pooling Layers:**
   - Used **Conv2D layers** to extract features from images.
   - Applied **MaxPooling2D** to reduce spatial dimensions.
   - Flattened the pooled feature maps.
   - Added Fully Connected (Dense) layers for classification.
   - Used **Softmax activation** to classify digits (0-9).

3. **Training and Evaluating the Model:**
   - Trained the CNN for **5 epochs**.
   - Evaluated the accuracy on the **test set**.

## **Key Observations**
- The model efficiently reduces image dimensions using **Max Pooling** while preserving important patterns.
- Achieved good accuracy on the MNIST dataset.
- Pooling layers helped in reducing computational complexity without losing critical features.

This concludes my exploration of **Pooling Layers in CNNs**. Pooling is a fundamental concept in deep learning that enhances the performance and efficiency of CNN-based models.
